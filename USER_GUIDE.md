## Understanding Results

### Result Components

Each search result contains up to three sections:

#### 1. Featured Answer (if available)
```
Featured Answer: The most popular game for [console] is...
```
This is a quick answer directly from Google's featured snippet.

#### 2. Answer Box (if available)
```
Answer: [Quick information about popular games]
```
This is a summary box with key information.

#### 3. Search Results (usually 3 results)
```
Result 1:
  Title: [Game Name]
  Info: [Description of the game]
```

Each result shows:
- **Title:** The name of the game
- **Info:** A brief description of what the game is about

### Interpreting Results

- **Featured Answer** appears first and is usually the most direct answer
- **Answer Boxes** provide additional context
- **Search Results** give you multiple perspectives and options
- The order generally reflects relevance to your search

### What If There Are No Results?

If you see this message:
```
No results found. Google's HTML structure may have changed...
```

This means the application couldn't find search results. This can happen because:
- Google may have changed their website layout
- Your search term might be too obscure
- Google might have temporarily blocked the request

**Solution:** Try again in a few minutes or try a different console name.

## Tips and Tricks

### Tip 1: Use Exact Console Names

**Works Better:**
- `Nintendo Switch` (specific)
- `PlayStation 5` (specific)

**May Return More Results:**
- `Switch` (might include other results)
- `PS5` (less consistent)

### Tip 2: Search Multiple Ways

If you're interested in a console, try searching different ways:

```
Enter: PlayStation 5
# Get top games currently

Enter: PlayStation 5 best games
# Get critically acclaimed games

Enter: PlayStation 5 exclusive games
# Get exclusives for the platform
```

### Tip 3: Understanding Popularity vs. Quality

Search results show **current popularity**, which may differ from:
- All-time best games
- Critical scores
- Sales numbers
- Personal preferences

Use this tool to discover what's trending, not necessarily the "best" games.

### Tip 4: Cross-Reference Results

Don't rely on a single search result. Look at multiple results to get a fuller picture:
- Different sources may have different opinions
- Popularity changes over time
- New games are constantly releasing

### Tip 5: Keep Your Internet Connection Strong

The application needs internet to search Google:
- Make sure you have a stable connection
- A slow connection might timeout
- A blocked network (like some workplaces) might prevent access
